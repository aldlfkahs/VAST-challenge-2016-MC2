### Introduction
This project is the answer of [VAST Challenge 2016 Mini-Challenge 2](http://vacommunity.org/2016+VAST+Challenge%3A+MC2).
Our team visualized proxy data and building data using D3 library. Using the results, we analyzed each pattern as well as the combined pattern of the two.

### My part
I was in charge of proxy data part. You can see visualized result [here](https://aldlfkahs.github.io/VAST-challenge-2016-MC2/proxy_card_data_chart.html). You can use the x-axis and y-axis scrollbar to navigate through the graph. If mouse is on the graph,
tooltip box shows the information of that time. “Task” means the location of employee (mFnZ means
m’th floor n zone), “Type” means the proxy ID of employee, “Starts” and “Ends” means the entering
time and exiting time respectively. Each location is distinguished by color.
